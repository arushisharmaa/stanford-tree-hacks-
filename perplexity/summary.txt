Mitosis and meiosis are two types of cell division with distinct purposes and outcomes. Mitosis produces two genetically identical diploid daughter cells for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction, involving chromosome duplication and separation of sister chromatids[1][2]. Meiosis, on the other hand, generates four genetically diverse haploid gametes for sexual reproduction, featuring two rounds of division with unique events like homologous chromosome pairing and crossing over[1][3]. The key differences lie in their purposes, number and genetic makeup of daughter cells, and specific events during the division processes[5][8].
