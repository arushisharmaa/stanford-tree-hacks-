A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in non-contiguous memory locations and connected using pointers. Unlike arrays with fixed sizes, linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink. The provided code visualizes a linked list with nodes A, B, C, D, and E, where E is inserted between C and D. Traversal of a linked list starts at the head and follows the next pointers until reaching the tail, which points to NULL.
