A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in non-contiguous memory locations and connected using pointers. Unlike arrays with fixed sizes, linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink. The diagram shows a linked list with nodes A, B, C, D, and E, where each node contains a value and pointers to the next node. Insertion of node E after C is demonstrated by updating the pointers, and traversal starts from the head node following the next pointers.
