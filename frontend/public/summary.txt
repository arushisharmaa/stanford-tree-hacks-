A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in non-contiguous memory locations and connected using pointers. Unlike arrays with fixed sizes, linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink. The diagram shows a linked list with nodes A, B, C, D, and E, where each node contains a value and pointers to the previous and next nodes. Insertion of a new node (E) is demonstrated by updating the pointers of adjacent nodes.
